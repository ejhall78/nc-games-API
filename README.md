# Northcoders House of Games API

## Project Summary

The purpose of this project is to build an API that allows access to application data programmatically.

The theme of the data is board games! Users can create, read, update and delete reviews of certain board games; comments on said reviews; the users that made the comments and the game categories.

Here is a link to the API so you can try it out for yourself: https://be-nc-games-ejhall78.herokuapp.com/
